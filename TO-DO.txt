TO-DO:
-Add 'continue' functionality to glyphsFull button to browse entirety of font file
-Add start, end control metadata to font glyphs. May need to back-compute offsets
to recreate the stroke abstraction
-Make sure font glyphs export appropriately as our machine-readable format
-Building alphabet to font file (rabbit-hole regarding proper intialization of metadata)

-Various quality-of-life animations for visualizing stroke order, etc.

Goals:
-Editable font glyphs
-Learnable font glyph export
-Seamless integration of algorithmic glyphs and font glyphs into alphabet
